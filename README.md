### Setup and launch demo-app

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --name colorization
conda activate colorization
streamlit run demo/demo-app.py -- --model_path=models/RGB_Latent32_best_model.pth.tar
```
Use the graphical interface to upload style and contet images. The images will be automatically resized to $128px\times128px$. The model takes only 400 MB, so it should work on most low-end devices.

### Alternative: Test the model with demo.ipynb
We also provide a Jupyter Notebook, that will easily allow the user to download and import the same datasets that were used for both training and testing.
This is ideal if you want to reproduce results in the form shown belo or if you want to further train the model.

NOTE: a Huggingface token is needed to run the training / download the dataset (this is not necessary to run the forward pass of the network). Create a .env file in the main directory and add `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN='YOUR TOKEN'`.

# Introduction

Colorization of grayscale images has been an area of significant interest in computer vision, with applications ranging from photo restoration to artistic expression. We propose an approach to colorize grayscale images in various artistic styles using a U-Net architecture enhanced with Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layers. U-Net, known for its effectiveness in semantic segmentation tasks, provides an ideal framework for our colorization task due to its ability to capture spatial dependencies while preserving fine details. By incorporating AdaIN layers into the U-Net architecture, we introduce the capability to adaptively transfer artistic styles (here we use style to refer to color choices) from reference images to grayscale inputs. AdaIN enables the decoupling of content and style in feature representations, allowing us to leverage the content information from grayscale images while infusing them with the stylistic characteristics extracted from reference color images. This style-guided colorization approach opens up new possibilities for artistic expression, allowing users to apply various painting styles, from impressionism to surrealism, to grayscale inputs.

# Results
Here are some examples for some random test images and random paintings. The first row always shows the colourization obtained by passing the groud truth image to the network, like in training phase. That is not a realistic scenario, since in practice the coloured image is not available. On the other hand, it provides a good baseline for comparinson.

We encourage then to experimnt yourself with any image of your choice from the [demo-app](./demo/demo-app.py) or with images from the [imagenet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k) and [wikiart](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/wikiart) datasets with the [demo.ipynb](./demo/demo.ipynb).
